      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>How does Reiki energy heal?</h3>
        <p>The word Reiki is combined from the Japanese “rei” meaning “higher power” and “ki” 
          meaning “life force energy”. Reiki has personally improved Rachel’s mood, emotional 
          well-being, sleep, and quality of life and decreased her anxiety, depression, pain, and 
          stress. <br/><br/>
          In fact, Reiki has been healing humans, animals, and plants since ancient times. Our 
          ancestors discovered that health and positive life circumstances result from an innate 
          flow of balanced energy within one’s physical and energetic bodies (the energy layers 
          around the body contained in the aura). Essentially, when stagnant energy is removed 
          and life force energy is raised, the result is healing of the mind, body, and spirit. 
          Reiki energy is activated the instant the practitioner sets the intention for it to begin 
          flowing. But they don’t cause the healing themselves. They become the channel for this 
          magickal life force energy, simply guiding the energy to flow through an individual for 
          their highest good. <br/><br/>
          Once flowing, a practitioner such as Rachel uses their hands to guide energy through 
          the physical body and aura. This causes deep relaxation, giving the body a break and 
          enhancing and accelerating one’s own natural healing process because they are no 
          longer stressed. <br/><br/>
          Reiki energy can be infused into inanimate objects and is perfect for charging crystals 
          as they absorb, store, and generate energy. Rachel especially loves infusing it into 
          jewellery because it balances the wearer’s energy with the Reiki energy to create a 
          sense of peace and serenity while wearing. <br/><br/>
          Reiki is magickal. It transcends time and space, which is why it can be sent remotely. It 
          flows to where it is needed and heals, never causing any harm or negative side effects. 
          It does what it wants. It functions similar to Spirit that way. We can ask Spirit to help us 
          with an intention or to deliver a message, but, like Reiki, we cannot force the outcome of 
          how this happens. <br/><br/>
          I keep this in mind when I invoke a Spirit Guide into the Reiki infusion to help manifest 
          the set intention. Then I surrender it to the universe. It’s that simple. When we have faith 
          and trust that everything will unfold the way it is meant to, we bear witness to beautiful, 
          healing magick. </p>
      </div>

        <h3>How do crystals heal?</h3>
        <p>If you’re wondering how crystal healing actually, scientifically works, let me explain. 
          Believe it or not, we’re already living in the Crystal Age. Crystals have played a huge 
          part in advancing the technological world we live in because they focus, store, transmit, 
          and transform energy. <br/><br/>
          In the words of Albert Einstein, “Everything in life is a vibration”. This means that what 
          we perceive as our physical, material world is composed of particles vibrating at 
          different frequencies. These frequencies, aka vibrations, influence our perspectives, 
          thoughts, and emotions since we’re always interacting with our environment as energy. 
          Human beings have an atomic structure and frequency that is unstable, continuously 
          healing and transforming. Our energy tunes into our world through entrainment, a 
          process in which we synchronize with an external influence that affects how we feel, 
          act, and move. An example is when your mood is lifted by a song, or darkened because 
          of someone else’s crummy mood. <br/><br/>
          Through this process, crystals use their stable, constant frequency to realign and 
          recalibrate our unstable energy. Their powerful vibrations from Mother Earth provide a 
          physical, tangible way for us to feel, connect with, and benefit from the crystals’ 
          vibrations. They can raise our energy where there is a lower frequency, balance our 
          energy if unbalanced, and help keep us in a higher vibrational state. <br/><br/>
          Crystals can also assist with moving past stagnant physical, mental, emotional, and 
          spiritual energy; especially when a crystal is paired with an intention, akin to a personal 
          goal, as the crystal’s energy amplifies the intention. When we unlock the power of 
          healing crystals, we bring our intentions to life and become the most evolved, 
          empowered versions of ourselves. Isn’t that what we came to Earth for?</p>

        <h3>Mermagickal works with a variety of Guides from Spirit. Are they gender specific?</h3>
        <p>While it is true that Rachel works with various Divine Masculine and Feminine Spirit 
          Guides, such as Gods and Goddesses, she views them as gender neutral and instead 
          focuses on their energy. <br/><br/>
          Essentially, Divine Masculine energy is action-based, focusing on logic, assertiveness, 
          and confidence, whereas Divine Feminine energy is focused on being rather than doing, 
          including being intuitive, sensual, and emotional. <br/><br/>
          Rachel believes that these yin-yang energies can be accessed by anyone, regardless of 
          gender, and need to be balanced in order for us to be happy and healthy. This is why 
          Mermagickal promotes the harmony of these gender neutral energies, noting that the 
          right balance can vary for individuals.<br/><br/>
          In light of this, even when a Spirit Guide is given a male or female name or title, such as 
          God or Goddess, Rachel does this to honour the Divine Masculine or Feminine energy 
          that they exude, not their gender. <br/><br/>
          The intent is truly to make Mermagickal an inclusive space, as that’s what each and 
          every one of us deserves.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>What happens in a mediumship reading?</h3>
        <p>Evidential mediumship is a form of communication between a medium and an 
          individual’s loved one(s) in Spirit. The intent of the reading is to allow the individual to 
          re-connect to and feel the presence of their departed loved ones. <br/><br/>
          In a reading, information is received through Rachel’s intuitive senses and is delivered 
          to the individual. This can be information about the loved one(s) in Spirit, such as their 
          physical appearance or personality. It can also be information tied to the individual 
          receiving the reading, or their family. An example could be a fond memory that was 
          once shared. Healing messages are often brought through a reading, and signs and 
          ways for the individual to maintain their spiritual connection to their loved ones after the 
          reading.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What can I expect in an oracle card reading?
        </h3>
        <p>Oracle cards are a divination tool that have been used since ancient times. They are a 
          powerful way to receive guidance from Spirit and receive clarity and perspective shifts 
          about one’s life. <br/><br/>
          In a reading, Rachel intuitively chooses a deck of oracle cards to provide guidance to an 
          individual. This guidance can be general or the individual can request that Rachel ask 
          specific questions. Questions often revolve around themes like health, career, etc. 
          Rachel pulls oracle cards from the deck, intuitively interpreting their words and imagery 
          while channeling messages from Spirit. </p>
