      <p class="title">What makes Mermagickal unique? Crystal creations that are infused with the power of
        intention, Reiki energy, and Spirit, and cleansed through Mother Earth’s elements! Let
        me explain…</p>
      <div class="d1 column">
        <h2>Setting and Manifesting Intentions
        </h2>
        <p>Mermagickal crystal creations focus on the power of intentions. What are intentions?
          Intentions are our soul’s deepest desires, or the dreams that we can make come true in
          our lives.</p>
        <p>
          As powerful, magickal, Divine beings, we can choose to set and release our intentions
          into the universe. In doing so, they act as seeds of change in manifesting our desired
          reality (with inspired action and in Divine timing, of course). Think of it in terms of
          energy, as energy flows where intention goes. For example, if you’re looking to attract
          self-love, setting this intention signals to the universe that you are ready to receive it.</p>
        <p>
          Each of Mermagickal’s crystal creations focuses on setting a specific intention. I do this
          by using a combination of intuitively chosen crystals, all of which have a specific
          connection to amplify the intention. I then program the intention into the crystals so that
          the crystals’ energy is focused. This ensures that the crystals are much more powerful
          and effective in cultivating the intention when they reach you.</p>
        <p>
          Mermagickal writes out each of the crystals’ connections to the specific intention. This
          description is provided to you keep you focused on your intention. Why? Because the
          universe loves and thrives on detailed, specific requests... and I want to optimize its
          manifestation power for you</p>
      </div>
      <div class="d2 column">
        <h2>Charging with Reiki Energy
        </h2>
        <p>Reiki is a universal life force energy with limitless healing properties. It targets where a
          human’s life force energy needs it most, removing stagnant energy while raising life
          force energy. The result is healing on all levels; mind, body, and spirit.</p>
        <p>
          Mermagickal crystal creations are charged and permanently infused with Reiki energy.
          This works beautifully as crystals absorb, store, and generate energy and it is important
          to keep them charged. This is because they are no longer naturally replenished from
          Mother Earth’s energy once they are harvested from her</p>
        <p>
          Reiki is also infused to balance the owner’s energy with the Reiki energy to create a
          deeper sense of peace and serenity while using the crystal creation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="d3 column">
        <h2>Healing from the Spirit Realm
        </h2>
        <p>To add extra healing during the Reiki charging, Mermagickal intuitively invokes a unique
          Spirit Guide to amplify the intention of the creation.</p>
        <p>
          Spirit Guides can include Angels and Archangels, Ascended Masters, Cosmic and
          Elemental Guides, Gods and Goddesses, Spirit Animals, and many more magickal
          Guides from the Spirit realm.</p>
        <p>
          A description is provided explaining which Spirit Guide was chosen and why, allowing
          you to develop and strengthen your spiritual relationship with them. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="d4 column">
        <h2>Cleansing through Mother Earth’s Elements
        </h2>
        <p>It is beneficial to cleanse and charge your crystals regularly to restore them to their
          natural state, releasing any energy that they’ve absorbed. </p>
        <p>
          Before arriving to you, Mermagickal creations are cleansed with the smoke from Mother
          Earth’s palo santo, as well as the sound from Eastern singing bowls. </p>
        <p>
          I then provide you with instructions detailing the various methods to cleanse and charge
          your crystals, so that the crystals’ intentions and energy can remain optimized in your
          healing space.</p>
        <p>
          Mermagickal writes out each of the crystals’ connections to the specific intention. This
          description is provided to you keep you focused on your intention. Why? Because the
          universe loves and thrives on detailed, specific requests... and I want to optimize its
          manifestation power for you</p>
